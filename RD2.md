##### Objective:  
* Decode a cipher from a file with a key file back into english in another file

##### Procedure:
* ask user for input file, error check
* ask user for output file name
* read initial file
* convert cipher key into a table
* using the key, read a file and with the key decipher write into english onto another file
* This lab gives you practice with: Using dictionaries, Following problem-solving techniques, Creating functions, Doing file I/O

##### Results:
* Results match expected
* I tried a few test cases to check errors and all seemed good

##### Reflection:
* One of the challenges we encountered were coming up with the basic functions
* We first planned high level tasks, then coded, then tested
* We talked the tasks over and came up with a solution then split the work
* A key takeaway was better understanding of how we can use tables to interact with the contents of a file
* I think I learned what I was supposed to.
* Working with Ethan was fantastic. We were able to get a good start in lab coming up with a start on the solution.
Then, we were able to communicate well on how to split up the remaining work over the next week to.
