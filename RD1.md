* Drive Full Name  : Ethan D’Souza
* Partner Full Name: Lucas Podowski
* Student ID: 1735988


Objective:
The objective of this lab was to:
* Learn how to use dictionaries for efficient key-value data storage and retrieval.
* Practice file input/output operations to process and write data to files.
* Develop problem-solving skills by following a systematic algorithm to decode Morse code into English.
* Collaborate effectively with a partner to design, implement, and debug a program.
Procedure:
1. Steps Followed:
o Lucas and I collaborated on designing the algorithm. Together, we broke down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks:
* Prompting the user for file names.
* Loading the Morse code translation into a dictionary.
* Reading and translating the input file into English.
* Writing the translated output to a new file.
o Lucas implemented the first part of the program, which involved creating the input_filename() function for error-checked file input and starting the read_file_to_table() function.
2. Techniques Used:
o We tested each part iteratively, adding debugging statements to verify outputs at each step.
o Debugging the dictionary was key to ensuring Morse code mappings were correct.
3. Key Concepts Explored:
o Efficient use of dictionaries to map Morse code to English.
o File handling techniques for reading and writing text files.
o Collaborative problem-solving and algorithm design.


Results:
1. Matching Expectations:
o The final results matched our expectations. The program successfully converted Morse code input into English output.
2. Test Cases Used:
o We tested various input files, including:
* Used morse1.txt, morse2.txt, and morse3.txt, and created new files for them.
Reflection:
1. Challenges Encountered:
o Initially, the dictionary was not loading correctly due to formatting issues in the morsecode.txt file.
o Some Morse code sequences in the input file did not match the dictionary because of trailing or extra spaces.
2. Following the First Three Rules of Programming:
o Identify the Problem:
We analyzed the task, understood the required inputs/outputs, and wrote an algorithm to approach the problem.
o Design and Plan:
We divided the program into smaller functions and outlined clear responsibilities for each.
o Execute and Test:
We implemented the program iteratively, testing and debugging each part to ensure correctness.
3. Overcoming Challenges:
o We resolved dictionary formatting issues by carefully debugging the read_file_to_table() function and ensuring .strip() was applied to remove unnecessary whitespace.


4. Key Takeaways:
o Collaboration is crucial, and dividing tasks while maintaining consistent communication helped us work efficiently.
o Debugging is an integral part of programming, especially for file processing and dictionary-based tasks.
o Following a structured algorithm made the problem much easier to tackle.
5. Learning Outcome:
o Yes, I believe I learned everything I was supposed to for this lab. I am now more confident with dictionaries, file I/O.
6. Working with Lucas:
o Working with Lucas was great. He was highly collaborative and contributed significantly to both the algorithm design and the initial implementation of the program. He communicated effectively and made debugging easier by pointing out potential issues.
